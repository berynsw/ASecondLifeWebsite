                    What is the problem?
                </span>
                Consumption of disposable and one-time-use products contributes to a lot of waste and in turn has a high environmental cost. Consumable products both cost energy and other valuable resources to create and of course pollute the environment when they are thrown away.

                    What are you trying to solve?
                </span>
                We are trying to make a positive impact on the issue of environmental destruction from excessive waste production.

                    Which SDG goals (among 17) are you trying to achieve?
                </span>
                We are trying to achieve the SDG goals of climate action, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, and life on land.

                <span class="question">
                    Why is this an important problem? Is there any global impact?
                </span>
                Many people are not aware of ways they can reuse items in their homes. More often than not, our garbage cans get filled with all sorts of items that can be used for something else. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the average person in America produces 4.9 pounds of municipal solid waste each day. While recycling is a great way to become more environmentally conscious, many are unaware of the importance of reusing. Products such as plastic containers and grocery bags do not break down for many years while they sit in landfills. Finding ways to reuse these products once or twice more before they potentially end up in landfills will dramatically reduce the amount of plastic entering the environment. We believe that A Second Life could have a global impact because our website can be reached by anyone with a computer and a curiosity to learn about how upcycling can have a positive impact on the environment.

                    Who are the target users? Why should they care?
                </span>
                Our target users are those who want to take small steps towards a more sustainable lifestyle, especially if they do not know how. Users should care because it is important to help contribute to the sustainability of one’s community and planet.

                    How many people (should be at least millions of people) will be benefited from your solution? Give evidence(s) of your claim by giving statistics from the previous studies or from any reputed organizations such as WHO, UN, CDC:
                </span>
                According to edtimes the fashion industry is responsible for 10% of global carbon emissions which is more than the emissions of international flights. 1.2 billion tons of CO2 is released in the atmosphere every year by the fast fashion industry. The dyes and other chemicals used to cause massive environmental damage. Just by reusing old clothes or thrifting them for 4-5 months, carbon emission by 4%. This was just for clothes, now think what would plastic do to our environment ? Moreover, The UN states that “Should the global population reach 9.6 billion by 2050, the equivalent of almost three planets could be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles”. Serious problem right ? 

With our project we are targeting to affect and benefit not just millions but billions of people and more then that, we are targeting to benefit the environment! In today’s world, major changes are dependent on youth voice and change towards sustainability, global warming and carbon emission starts with us!

                    What is your solution?
                </span>
                Our solution is our website, “A Second Life”, which aims to help educate people how to reuse many items we would consider as "single use". Users will be able to type in the item or category of the item they would like to reuse into a search bar, and the results will be a list of creative and practical ideas guiding users to make their next step with said item. The list will include a range of ideas, such as for decoration, for storage, organization, and more. The list will also include links to resources who share the same vision of sustainability by using donated used-items for new purposes as well. Along with the list will be a short and easy to understand description educating the user on the effects that specific item (or category of item) usually has on the planet (e.g. time to break down, what ecosystems are affected, amount of production, etc.) We will use a website as our choice of technology for the purpose of being accessible to the widest range of population possible. The goal is to help people become more aware of the amount of waste they produce each day, and work towards lessening that amount over time in order to improve our environments and create a more sustainably conscious community.

                    How is your solution different than the existing solutions?
                </span>
                In our research of other solutions like ours we did not find another website/app that had upcycles for single use products where you could search by material of an item to find the upcycle. Also, across our research other similar websites and apps did not include a resource page listing places to donate used items and recommendations for brands that use sustainable solutions when managing waste

                </span>
                We decided to use a website as the platform for our solution. We chose to make a website instead of an app so that our solution could reach more users including the ones that might not have access to a smartphone.

                    Explain your systematic literature review. How many papers did you read? Write a summary of your findings:
                </span>
                As a group we collectively read 10 research papers on related topics to our project. Through our research we found two main aspects of the papers that related most to our project. These two findings were the urgency of the waste crisis and how teaching the practice of upcycling is a great way to teach the importance of sustainability to all ages. Through our research, we learned that if waste production does not peak this century we will have negative irreversible effects on the environment. Knowing this has fueled our passion for creating a website that helps to inform people on simple ways to reduce their production of waste and teach them how to be more sustainable in their daily lives. The other big takeaway from our research was how important it is to teach the idea of upcycling. In one article, it explained how children from two different communities were represented with items that were normally seen as trash and asked them to create something out of them. They were able to come up with ideas such as creating a couch and a snowglobe out of items they normally see as trash. This helped to support our thoughts of if you are able to reframe someones thinking about a single use item they will come up with another way to use it just like an upcycle and in turn cut down on the amount of garbage they put out into the environment.

                </span>
                As a group we analyzed 12 different systems, some being apps and some being websites. From this analysis, we found some similar websites/apps like ours, A Second Life, but none that were exactly the same concept. From the research, we decided something that would be important to add to our page, that we saw on other systems, was a resource page. Our research page would include information on where to take items no longer being used so they can be taken care of in a sustainable way and information on brands that use and support sustainable practices.

                </span>
                As a group we conducted four user studies. One of the biggest findings of our interviews were that many people were not as familiar with the idea of upcycles as we thought. Learning this was very helpful, now we knew that we would need to have a comprehensive explanation of what an upcycle is and how making them can have a positive impact on the environment. With this information we decided to implement a new user guide page. This page would end up including information on what an upcycle is, how it helps the planet, and how to get started on our website. We also decided to play around with the search/explore bar on our front navigation, but ultimately we took out the search bar in our final prototype.

                </span>
                For the front-end, we used Vue.js which is a javascript library. We used the component concept to reuse our environment and to link our pages together and NPM core modules to run our server. We used Vue Router to add routes to our website to make the flow of our working environment easier. To transfer data from parent component to child component, we used the Vue props which acts as a global variable for all the different pages and sends data from one page to another. And finally for UI/UX we used HTML and CSS to make it look more presentable. For back-end, to fetch our upcycle data we used Node.js. We created a mini database using node and called those data in our upcycle page to show different types of upcycles. That data is delivered to the front end by an http request to the express server that we created.

                </span>
                In terms of the implementation of the web app, there are a variety of ways that it could be extended and made more dynamic/reusable. To start with, the website could be connected to a file storage service such as Amazon S3 to store the upcycle images. This would allow users of the app to upload their own upcycle ideas. If the website were to really get a lot of user traffic, it would probably also make sense to have a scalable hosting setup and a more automated and professional deployment setup. In terms of the overall goal for the project, it would make sense to add more functionality to the individual upcycle pages and perhaps also have overarching items pages that would provide the user with information about the environmental impacts of that particular item and the various things that the user can do to counteract problems associated with that particular item. This is something we plan to work on if we continue the project.
