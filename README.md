After downloading repository:

  To easily edit html/css design elements (frontend):
  1. go into repo folder and open index.html with browser
  2. to see the result after making changes simply refresh page in browser

  Once we want to have stored data and load it into the frontend we'll need to start the web server/backend:
  1. download and install node.js : https://nodejs.org/en/download/ . may have to restart computer before running node
  2. open repo in vscode
  3. in vscode terminal (or any terminal) type: 'node server.js' (this will start the javascript express server)
  4. type 'localhost' into your browser and you should see 'Home Page blah blah' this means our node server sent index.html to the browser
